## Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains code from a personal project in which I implement a CNN classifier in PyTorch and train it on a brain tumor classification dataset found on kaggle.

The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri



### TODO:

- add code for creating checkpoints to store and load models from previous training runs
- fix overfitting by means of regularization, data augmentation, or further fine-tuning of the Dropout layers
- add Jupyter notebooks to showcase results
