## Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains code from a personal project in which I implement a CNN classifier in PyTorch and train it on a brain tumor classification dataset found on Kaggle.

The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri

For a demo of the model, see the notebook **training_demo.ipynb**.



### TODO:

- fix overfitting by means of regularization, data augmentation, or further fine-tuning of the Dropout layers
